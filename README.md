# NLP Text Classification Project

This project is a simple yet powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow using Python and NLTK.  
It performs basic data exploration and tokenization on a text dataset to prepare it for classification or analysis tasks.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used is a CSV file contained in a ZIP archive (`/archive (9).zip`).  
It consists of text samples categorized under different labels (stored in the `CATEGORY` column).

## üìö Project Workflow

- Load and preview the dataset (`pandas`)
- Analyze text categories (`value_counts`)
- Preprocess text using `NLTK`:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopwords removal
  - WordNet support for lemmatization (future scope)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
