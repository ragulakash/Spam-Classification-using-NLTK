# Spam-Classification-using-NLTK
This project demonstrates the foundational steps of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python's NLTK library. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, and text preprocessing techniques like tokenization. The primary goal is to prepare textual data for building future machine learning models such as text classifiers.
